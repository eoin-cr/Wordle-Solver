# Wordle solver
Word list is sorted from most common to least.  User enters letter info and it deletes any words that don't match the criteria and prints the top 20 that do.  Probably not great for early game.

Personally I don't see the fun in using a program to beat the game, I just thought it would be a fun thing to code, but you do you ig.
